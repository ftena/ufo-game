        It is worth noting that even though we are working with a 2D sprite
        we are using a vector3 to rotate the collectable's transform.
        This is because the transform of the 2D sprite still exists in the 3D volume.
        When using the transform component with 2D objects we simply ignore
        the axis we don't need.
